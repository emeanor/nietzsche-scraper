# Nietzsche Scraper
This is a basic utility to scrape texts from the online critical edition of Nietzsche's works for use in my [Nietzsche project](https://github.com/emeanor/nietzsche). It utilizes Selenium for the web scraping, and Beautiful Soup to parse the texts and convert them to Markdown so that they can be easily stored in a database.
